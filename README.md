ArchSysSim is a comprehensive simulation tool that integrates key components of computer architecture and organization. The project includes a functional Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), memory hierarchy (L1 and L2 cache, main memory), and processing units, with accompanying lexer and parser functionality for handling assembly-like instructions. It simulates the interaction between a system's hardware components, such as registers, processors, and caches, to explore the effects of architectural design on application performance. The project provides a practical framework for analyzing how software and hardware interact in modern computing systems, supporting both simulation and testing of system-level operations.
